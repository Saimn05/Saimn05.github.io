The website is conceived as a lean, performance‑focused resume and portfolio for early‑career aerospace roles. Its information architecture is intentionally shallow and predictable (Home/About, Projects, Experience, Contact), reducing cognitive load and aligning with user‑centred design heuristics. Distinct color themes—derived from aerospace contexts such as deep space navy, NASA blues, cockpit grey, and radar green—create visual segmentation without sacrificing brand consistency or readability.

To meet framework and layout criteria, Bootstrap 5’s grid and utilities are layered over semantic HTML. Containers, rows, and columns govern page composition across breakpoints, while utility classes manage spacing and typography. This framework usage is deliberately minimal: it complements custom CSS rather than obscuring the site’s semantic structure, demonstrating mastery of both framework conventions and base web standards.

Accessibility and performance are first‑class concerns. Landmark elements (header, nav, main), a skip link, visible focus states, and descriptive alt text support keyboard and assistive‑technology users. Images include explicit width and height to limit layout shift; lazy loading and a single deferred JS file reduce initial payload. The small JavaScript bundle provides a starfield animation (rate‑limited, paused when hidden), a lightweight page transition, a robust lightbox (ESC and click‑away dismissal), and a progressive enhancement that lists recent GitHub repositories. There are no render‑blocking third‑party scripts or trackers.

Projects use authentic domain imagery—prototype, aircraft, plots, and a code snapshot—to connect engineering interests with tangible artifacts and development practices. Experience entries emphasize concise, scannable content. A downloadable PDF résumé satisfies recruiter workflows and the assignment requirement for a résumé artifact.

Validation and QA (documented separately) include W3C HTML/CSS validation, Lighthouse checks (FCP/LCP/CLS), cross‑browser testing (Chrome/Firefox/Safari), and informal usability sessions with three participants. Feedback led to larger tap targets (full‑card project links), clearer labels, and spacing adjustments for small screens.

Overall, the concept balances brand identity (palette and imagery), professional narrative (clear sections and copy), and technical quality (Bootstrap grid, semantic structure, accessibility, and performance). It addresses SLO1–SLO5 through visual design decisions, planned iteration, standards‑compliant implementation, and practical optimisation of images and scripts.
