Participants: 3 (2 students, 1 non‑technical). Devices: iPhone 13 (Safari), Pixel 6 (Chrome), Windows laptop (Chrome/Firefox).

Tasks
1) Find the most technical project and open a full‑size image.  
2) Locate and download the résumé.  
3) Find the contact email and send a test message (mailto).  
4) From Home, navigate to Experience and identify the latest role.

Outcomes
- Task 1: 3/3 successful. Two participants initially tapped the project title; converting the entire card to a clickable anchor improved completion time by ~30%.  
- Task 2: 3/3 successful. Prominence of the résumé link increased (button style and secondary link on Contact).  
- Task 3: 3/3 successful. Clarified “Quick Contact (mailto)” to reduce hesitation.  
- Task 4: 3/3 successful. Sticky header and consistent labels aided orientation.

Changes implemented
- Full‑card anchors for project tiles (larger tap targets).  
- Skip link for keyboard users; stronger focus outlines.  
- Adjusted spacing and line‑length for small screens; clarified button labels.

Planned follow‑ups
- Optional project filtering (e.g., “Simulation”, “Hardware”, “Web”).  
- Publish Lighthouse metrics (FCP/LCP/CLS) and validator screenshots in Validation_and_QA.md.  
- Inline critical CSS and consider a small service worker for offline access (progressive enhancement).
